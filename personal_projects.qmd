### Cooking
Some of my fondest childhood memories are centered around food. In particular, I loved the holidays because my grandmother would cook tons of her famous arroz con gandules, a.k.a. yellow rice and peas. 

**Insert recipe here**


### Photography 
I enjoy taking pictures because it is a great way to record history and savor memories. My Instax Mini Evo Hybrid is pretty cool because it can print pictures out on film *and* upload digital pictures to a computer. I am very new to photography and by no means an expert-- I just do it because it's fun! Here are three pictures I took in the last few months: 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="750px", out.width='500px', fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Amber, the 10-week old mini-poodle, on her first picnic in Central Park"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Amber.jpg")
```
&nbsp;  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="300px", out.width='500px', fig.align = "center", fig.cap="The Grand Palladium Resort in Montego Bay, Jamaica"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/JA.jpg")
```
&nbsp;  


```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="750px", out.width='500px', fig.align = "center", fig.cap="The Djurg√•rden Loop in Stockholm, Sweden"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Skansen.jpg")
```
