:::{#alma}


My name is Dillon Sparks and I am an aspiring data scientist. I use data to tell stories that promote educational, racial, and economic equity. I am currently searching for a data analyst or data scientist role, preferably in the social impact sector, to draw on my extensive nonprofit and education work experience in addition to my data analysis, visualization, and machine learning skills. I carefully curated this online space to share my professional mission, academic accomplishments, professional endeavors, and hobbies/interests with prospective employers and friends alike. The code for this website can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/dillonsparks/personal-website)
