My name is Dillon Sparks and I am an aspiring data scientist who specializes in data storytelling and using data to promote educational, social, and economic equity. I am currently searching for a data analyst or data scientist role in the social impact sector which will draw on my extensive nonprofit and education work experience in addition to my data analysis and visualization skills. This website is meant to share my professional mission, academic accomplishments, professional endeavors, and hobbies/interests. I carefully curated this space (using Quarto and R Markdown) to give prospective employers and friends a peek into different areas of my life. 

Outline of my "why"?

* Growing up privileged/with additional resources/guidance that wasn't readily available to many peers 
* Getting to Georgetown & working with the CSJ; seeing the impact of the school to prison pipeline. Saw how important access is 
* Realizing that work on the ground is absolutely necessary but I want to impact even more students/young people by taking a quantitative approach to solving the same problems 
* Found data science & learned more about other systemic inequities that I can use data science to disrupt/serve the same populations I want to serve 

** Include a paragraph or two here about why I'm actually invested in data science & tie it back to education, etc. It should use similar language to that already in my personal statements **
